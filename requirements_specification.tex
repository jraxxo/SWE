\chapter{Product Purpose}
To handle the addition of new books and the distribution in a better way, "BookExpress" asked us to develop an IT solution to optimize the idle time and labour usage by getting rid of the current, deprecated system. Furthermore one important goal of the software solution is to be very user friendly and easy to use; also there should be remote access implemented, so several customers can access the software at once and distribution partners can access and keep their book stock up to date.
\section{Obligatory Requirements (``must have'')}
\subsection{Communication with Publishers}
The direct connection between the \textbf{publishers} and BookExpress shall be implemented by providing a web interface for the publishers.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item As each publisher also has a PIN, it will be used as the account name for the interface.
\item The web interface has to provide the following features for the publisher: maintain the book database (add books, remove books, edit book data), edit their personal data, view statistics on how often which books are bought
\item The interface has to be comfortably accessible from mobile devices as well, the data that is transmitted should be minimal\\
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Communication with Customers}
The direct connection between the \textbf{customers} and BookExpress shall also be implemented by providing a web interface for the customers.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item As each customer already has a unique identifier, the PIN, we will use it as an account name for the login.
\item The web interface has to provide the following features: view catalogue and stock, submit orders, view  the current state of their orders and cancel them (if they haven't been shipped yet)
\item The system has to assign a unique ID to each order, ideally incorporating the PIN of the customer
\item The interface has to be comfortably accessible from mobile devices as well, the data that is transmitted should be minimal\\
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Internal Administration}
The employees of BookExpress shall be provided a web interface as well. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Each employee will get a unique user ID to log into the web interface. Ideally, this will be formatted along the lines of surname.name or something similar.
\item The web interface must provide the following features for the employees: processing, editing and cancellation  of submitted orders, directly contact the customers and publishers as well as the truck fleet and the warehouse
\item Furthermore, the underlying system shall generate logfiles with login times, error codes and statistics (e.g. which books are ordered the most and by whom) for the publishers and the accounting and IT department / tech support.
\item The interface has to be comfortably accessible from mobile devices as well, the data that is transmitted should be minimal\\ 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Support}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system should be as automatic as possible - we need a good, user-oriented manual.
\item Additionally, a context-sensitive help tool has to be implemented in the interface itself. 
\item Moreover, As we want to make sure that the system is as reliable as possible, we will need a dedicated support team that is available 24/7 and can be dispatched in less than 2 hours to fix critical issues.
\end{itemize}

\section{Optional Requirements (``nice to have'')}
\begin{itemize}
\item Book Stores should be able to save recurring orders
\item Book Stores should be notified when the delivery of their order is imminent\\
\end{itemize}

\section{Non-Requirements (``need not have'')}
\begin{itemize}
\item The software should not allow final customers to buy books. It is only intended for retailers.
\item Moreover, invoices are generated elsewhere, as well as financial reports, so the system should not interfere with that.\\
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Product Environment}
The Product takes the orders from the book stores and files them into the system, so that they can be prepared for shipping. For different sized book stores there should be several account types with separate functionality and different options for packaging and ordering. The targeting groups of the software solution are the book store owners(our consumers), the assistants of "BookExpress" and the distribution partners.
\section{Application Area}
The new IT system should replace the old system and provide administrative and commercial functions to relieve the employees of unnecessarily complex administrative tasks. Certain processes can be handled without any interaction at all, e.g. if a book runs low in stock, the system will automatically order new copies from the publisher.
\section{User Groups}
\begin{itemize}
\item BookExpress commercial employees
\item BookExpress IT employees
\item Publishers
\item Book Stores
\end{itemize}

\chapter{User Interface}
Description of user interface elements for the client application and the web interface. Also a brief specification of the user rights management.

\section{Client Application (for clerks)}
\noindent
\begin{tabular}{llp{8cm}}
\cellcolor{white}/U10/	& \textbf{Name}			& Interface\\
\cellcolor{white}		& \textbf{Description}	& A clean and simple interface for the application should be developed, following BookExpress guidelines incorporated with recognizable and consistent menu structures and nomenclature. Integrating Drag\&Drop functionality into the interface to catch text- and file drops is also a necessity.\\
\cellcolor{white}		\hfill \\
\end{tabular}

\noindent
\begin{tabular}{llp{8cm}}
\cellcolor{white}/U11/	& \textbf{Name}			& Input Handling\\
\cellcolor{white}		& \textbf{Description}	& Much like in the web interface the client should be always informed when his data might be inconsistent or contain errors - sanity checks should display information where necessary. Also an auto completion should appear where appropriate to support the user - this should also apply to Drag\&Dropped input.\\
\cellcolor{white}		\hfill \\
\end{tabular}

\noindent
\begin{tabular}{llp{8cm}}
\cellcolor{white}/U12/	& \textbf{Name}			& Performance\\
\cellcolor{white}		& \textbf{Description}	& The application should have a maximum boot time of 5 seconds, loading more complex data in background threads to speed up the process. The application should for no other task take longer than 2 to 3 seconds, but if an delay is experienced through locked CPU, full memory, network delays or other means which cannot be affected by the application itself, there should be an appropriate message indicating that the application is experiencing unexpected delays.\\
\cellcolor{white}		\hfill \\
\end{tabular}

\noindent
\begin{tabular}{llp{8cm}}
\cellcolor{white}/U13/	& \textbf{Name}			& Data Consistency\\
\cellcolor{white}		& \textbf{Description}	& The application should make auto saves and save its working data as often as possible from memory to the hard drive to be able to recover from an unexpected system failure or experienced error. Also there should be a revisioning system implemented to handle wrongly entered data and make reverting to previous states as easy as possible. There should be at least 25 steps of retention.\\
\cellcolor{white}		\hfill \\
\end{tabular}

\section{Web Interface (for customers)}
\noindent
\begin{tabular}{llp{8cm}}
\cellcolor{white}/U20/	& \textbf{Name}			& Interface\\
\cellcolor{white}		& \textbf{Description}	& An easy to use interface should be developed through clear structures and responsible use of styling elements, especially an appropriate amount of whitespace.\\
\cellcolor{white}		\hfill \\
\end{tabular}

\noindent
\begin{tabular}{llp{8cm}}
\cellcolor{white}/U21/	& \textbf{Name}			& Compatibility\\
\cellcolor{white}		& \textbf{Description}	& New web technologies such as \acrshort{html}5, \acrshort{css}3 and modern \gls{js} libraries like jQuery or Dojo should be used to deliver an appealing user experience, but downwards compatibility for different browsers has to be ensured also. The major browsers should be supported to at least 1 previous major version, except \gls{ie} which should only be supported from IE9 onwards.\\
\cellcolor{white}		\hfill \\
\end{tabular}

\noindent
\begin{tabular}{llp{8cm}}
\cellcolor{white}/U22/	& \textbf{Name}			& Error Handling\\
\cellcolor{white}		& \textbf{Description}	& A graceful error handling should be realised through means of various \gls{js} technologies displaying error messages instantly and where appropriate, e.g. directly beneath or adjanced[wie schreibt man das] to where the error occured, or if it is an error returned from the server on the location for general error and information messages. Those messages should be short and easy to understand, massively long error codes like introduced in Microsoft Windows have to be avoided.\\
\cellcolor{white}		\hfill \\
\end{tabular}

\noindent
\begin{tabular}{llp{8cm}}
\cellcolor{white}/U23/	& \textbf{Name}			& Input Handling\\
\cellcolor{white}		& \textbf{Description}	& Whenever an user has to input data, several client and server based sanity checks should be employed to ensure consistent data. The client should, whenever appropriate, be supported by auto completion or suggest drop downs, speeding up data input and search processes.\\
\cellcolor{white}		\hfill \\
\end{tabular}

\section{Rights Management}
\noindent
\begin{tabular}{llp{8cm}}
\cellcolor{white}/U30/	& \textbf{Name}			& Roles\\
\cellcolor{white}		& \textbf{Description}	& Different types of users can perform different actions, this should be reflected by appropriate "views" for every user type.\\
\cellcolor{white}		& \textbf{Role}			& \textbf{Book Store Client}\\
\cellcolor{white}		&						& A book store client can see and edit parts of its own data, make new orders and edit orders it made.\\
\cellcolor{white}		&						& \textbf{Publisher Client}\\
\cellcolor{white}		&						& Publishers can see and edit their own data, including book information and the stock of books. Also it should be possible to display any placed orders and the correspondent order status. This status can also be updated.\\
\cellcolor{white}		&						& \textbf{BookExpress Employee}\\
\cellcolor{white}		&						& BookExpress employees can update, create and close orders, they take from publishers who call in with information or fax the information to BookExpress. They can also update book store and publisher user data, create new entries and edit information. The employees can also create new accounts for book stores and publishers.\\
\cellcolor{white}		&						& \textbf{Administration}\\
\cellcolor{white}		&						& Administrators have access to all data, have rights to create, edit and delete everything. Also administrators can create new accounts for BookExpress employees, restrict access and close accounts. All administrators are required to sign special disclosure agreements to protect the user data. There should be as few as possible administrator accounts created.\\
\cellcolor{white}		\hfill \\
\end{tabular}


\chapter{Non-Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item All connections through networks should be at least secured with a 512bit SSL encryption
	\item A redundant server base should be established to ensure high availability
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Those servers should also communicate with encryption between each other
			\item The servers should be on different server farms, in different physical locations
			\item The nearest server has to respond to client requests
			\item Maintenance for a specific server should not lead to data delivery delays but be compensated through other servers
		\end{itemize}
	\item Books are identified through their unique ISBN Code. If a book is not yet published or has - for whatever reason - no ISBN Code, an internal processing code should be temporarily used as identification
	\item Passwords should follow certain protocol, but this should not be enforced - only the length of a password should be enforced to be at least 8 characters to ensure a properly sized encryption hash
\end{itemize}

	\item All connections should be encrypted
\end{itemize}

\section{Interfaces (product)}
\label{sec:tpe-interfaces}
The application should be enhanced with interface integration of bar code scanners for easy recognition of ISBN codes, GPS tracking devices on the delivery trucks from BookExpress to save location and "process of delivery" real time. Also graphic tablets or other means of stylus input should be supported to be able to save signatures from delivery, processing and logistics in general.

No special interfaces are required for the web application, almost everything is processed through the browsers \gls{vm} and the rest, i.e. signatures for logistics, is realised through JavaScript and browser plugins.

	\end{itemize}
\section{Orgware}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Network connection to the Intranet and Internet
	\end{itemize}
\section{Interfaces (development)}
Same interfaces required as for \ref{sec:tpe-interfaces}

\chapter{Subproducts and Subsystems}
The product can be divided into 1 server sub product and 2 client sub products with a web interface or a separate application.

\section{Server}
The server application provides every interface with data, processes new, incoming data and reads and writes to the database. This product component provides all necessary functionality to operate the clients and data management. It has to be implemented from the start.

\section{Web Interface / Web Service}
The web interface provides the
